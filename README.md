# Overview
This is a chess game implemented using **Python** and Tkinter (standard GUI package). This chess game includes pixel designs for the pieces made using the pixel design application Aseprite. The game provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows players to move the pieces by clicking on them with the mouse and it implements the touch-move rule. Finally, the overarching goal is to allow for both human vs human (HvH) gameplay and human vs computer (HvC) gameplay using reinforcement learning.

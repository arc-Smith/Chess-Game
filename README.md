# Overview
This is a chess game with pixel designs for the pieces made by me using the pixel design application Aseprite. The game provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows players to move the pieces by clicking on them with the mouse. The project is implemented in Python using Tkinter (standard GUI package).

1 - click to move where if you touch a piece you must move that piece

2 - the whole board gets reset for legal moves after each piece move

3 - HumanVsHuman gameplay -> simply HumanVsComputer gameplay

4 - procedure for a new piece seems to be:
-get_legal_moves()
-move_piece()
-board.place_piece() under the not classes and not functions
-pieces.py

after pawn moves I can't move the rook

Back and forth gameplay may have to be implemented so I can test the check, checkmates

King can't enter the legal moves of another King or opposing Queen, Rook, Knight, Bishop
King can enter the legal move of a pawn by being in front of it
King castle will be afterwards.

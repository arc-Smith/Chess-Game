Draws:
[stalemate] 
no piece can move and there is not a check on the board at that moment (a check is done to see if there are no legal moves for any of the pieces perhaps there's a counter variable for all the legal moves of black / white if it is found to be there are 0 legal moves for the next player's turn then a draw is declared before piece selection)

[insufficient mating material] 
both sides have any of the following: (having an array of the current pieces on the board if it finds those specific combinations before selection of a piece then a draw is to be declared)
-lone king
-king and bishop
-king and knight

[3-fold repetition] 
if all other pieces are the same and the king + enemy piece checking it multiple times reach the same position a 2nd then 3rd time then 3-fold check has been found (as soon as the king is put into check then if it moves or if a piece interposes it then another check is made using the same piece then we can begin a sort of counter/checker for whether or not the same pos_r and pos_c are being reached)

if we see that a check is made then king is moved or interpose happens THEN we add this piece + pos_r and pos_c into three_fold_draw (THE FIRST being 1/3)

if another check happens we keep checking to see if the last move was a check
if we see that a second check is made then again add that piece + pos_r and pos_c 

if another check happens we keep checking to see if the last move was a check
if we see that a second check is made then again add that piece + pos_r and pos_c (THE SECOND being 2/3)

if another check happens we keep checking to see if the last move was a check
if we see that a second check is made then again add that piece + pos_r and pos_c

if another check happens we keep checking to see if the last move was a check
if we see that a second check is made then again add that piece + pos_r and pos_c (THE THIRD being 3/3)

Then by this point if we see that the pos_r and pos_c is in there 3 times then call a draw


[fifty move rule]
if no piece has been captured or no pawn has been moved in fifty consecutive moves then a draw is declared (each time a piece that's not a pawn is moved then fifty_move_draw gets +1 and each time a capture is NOT carried out then fifty_move_draw gets +1 on the other hand after each capture fifty_move_draw is set to 0 and after each pawn move fifty_move_draw is set to 0)

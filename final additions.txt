Checks:
-king is underattack by enemy piece after a turn so I must
1. move the king (making sure it has legal moves)
2. take the enemy piece (that square is a legal move of the king's ally)
3. interpose (a square in the legal moves of enemy is in the legal moves of the king's ally)

Checkmate:
-king is underattack by enemy piece after a turn and it'll return FALSE for each of the options if it was a check 
1. move the king (making sure it has legal moves)
2. take the enemy piece (that square is a legal move of the king's ally)
3. interpose (a square in the legal moves of enemy is in the legal moves of the king's ally)

Draws:
[stalemate] 
no piece can move and there is not a check on the board at that moment (a check is done to see if there are no legal moves for any of the pieces perhaps there's a counter variable for all the legal moves of black / white if it is found to be there are 0 legal moves for the next player's turn then a draw is declared before piece selection)

[insufficient mating material] 
both sides have any of the following: (having an array of the current pieces on the board if it finds those specific combinations before selection of a piece then a draw is to be declared)
-lone king
-king and bishop
-king and knight

[3-fold repetition] 
if all other pieces are the same and the king + enemy piece checking it multiple times reach the same position a 2nd then 3rd time then 3-fold check has been found ()

[fifty move rule]
if no piece has been captured or no pawn has been moved in fifty consecutive moves then a draw is declared (each time a piece that's not a pawn is moved then fifty_move_draw gets +1 and each time a capture is NOT carried out then fifty_move_draw gets +1 on the other hand after each capture fifty_move_draw is set to 0 and after each pawn move fifty_move_draw is set to 0)

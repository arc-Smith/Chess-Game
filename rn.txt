+++PINS
-I think skewers are taken care of because that's just a check then the piece moving (or not) thus allowing the other piece to be captured
-I think I was thinking of forks as checks specifically with the knight but there are other ways to do it that are just moving pretty much. AS SUCH, just need to handle pins and checks there to be able to automatically take care of the forks.
-Pins are in development.

+++check
-I think I should keep track of what black pieces can be clicked on because they either help INTERPOSE or it's the KING moving or it's TAKING the attacking piece. Have those actual piece positions as possible squares to select NOT JUST THE BLACK OR WHITE PIECES OVERALL
+++fix castling so that you CANNOT castle if a square is under attack

+++checkmate
+++draw
-Draw By Agreement (not needed I think)
-Insuffient Material
king vs king
king and bishop vs king
king and knight vs king
king and bishop vs king and bishop (of the same coloured square)
-Stalement
no more legal moves but it is one's turn
-Threefold repetition
thinking of having an array with the state of the board (i.e. self.squares) that will be set back to empty each time a piece is removed from the board. Besides that we keep adding to it and ALWAYS checking if the same 3 positions have been reached.
-Fifty Move Rule
have a fifty int counter that is reset after pawn moves and captures, if it ever reaches 50 then automatically end game 

+++flip board+display winner

+++making it more game based where a user selects if they want HvH or HvC
+++displaying the rules (like touch to move and whatnot)

+++different timed modes (not just unlimited)
